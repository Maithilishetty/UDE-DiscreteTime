# DiscreteTime-UDE
Discrete-Time Design and Applications of Uncertainty and Disturbance Estimator

Designing the Uncertainty and Disturbance Estimator (UDE), a robust control strategy, in discrete-time. 5 simulation examples provided in the DT-UDE folder:
1. UDE for continuous-time systems (CT UDE):
   Simulation of a new error-based continuous-time control law
2. UDE for discrete-time systems (DT UDE):
   Simulation of the derived error-based discrete-time control law
3. DT-UDE for CT systems (DT UDE for CT Plant):
   Controlling a CT plant using DT UDE designed in 2.
4. DT-UDE for Wing-Rock motion (DT UDE for Wing Rock):
   Using DT-UDE to control the nonlinear dynamics of wing rock motion
5. DT-UDE based observer for Wing Rock Motion (DT UDE for Wing Rock - Observer)
   Using an observer to estimate states and for designing the control law

Run data.m in each folder to execute the code.
