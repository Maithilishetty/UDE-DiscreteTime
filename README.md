## Discrete-Time Design and Applications of Uncertainty and Disturbance Estimator.


Extended the concept of Uncertainty and Disturbance Estimator (UDE) to the discrete-time domain. This repo consists of the simulation results for 4 different cases present in the 'Error Regulation Methods' folder which verifies the efficacy of the newly designed control law. Run the data.m file in each folder to view the results.
